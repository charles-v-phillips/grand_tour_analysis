# How a young pro cyclist should plan their racing season and general training to optimize results

For this project, I scraped data about one day races and grand tour stages from procyclingstats.com
Data includes age of winners, weight of winners, and course profile data (elevation gain, avg speed of winer, etc.)
From the data, i construct a guide for what races a young cyclist should enter and what races to aviod based on the scraped data.
Further, given the trends of the Grand Tours, I constuct a general guideline on how to structure training to optimize results based on the scraped data.
